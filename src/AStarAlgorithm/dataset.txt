# Nodes: 1,088,092
# Edges: 3,083,796
Format Description
Each line in the dataset contains two integers, separated by a tab, representing a directed edge in the graph.
This means that the edge has a starting (source) node and an ending #(destination) node, which creates a one-way link.

FromNodeId: This integer is the ID of the starting node, indicating where the edge originates.
ToNodeId: This integer is the ID of the destination node, indicating where the edge terminates.
Directed Graph: Each edge is directional, meaning it represents a one-way path from FromNodeId to ToNodeId.
Road Network Representation: Each node can be thought of as an intersection or location within Pennsylvania,
and each edge represents a road or path connecting two nodes in a specific direction.
Sparse Representation: The dataset only lists each edge once, so there are no
duplicate edges between the same nodes in the same direction.
